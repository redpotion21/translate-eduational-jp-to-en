# easy dict JP to EN

This is a JP to EN dictionary chrome extension made for educational purpose to learn Japanese for Engilsh speakers. This provides more explaination of the word to learn compared to just simply clicking translate button of chrome.

# Why use this tool

This is made for who learns Japanese by cross reading with English translated text. This method just requires simple clicks on the text to learn. But this simple method has a problem. By keep learning language with (target language and native language) pairs, this could make a shortcut in brain. When target language is given, it will first translate that to its native language, then translate that native words to a language that brain could directly understand. But native speakers proccess translate that language to ones that brain could directly understand. When processing with prior way, it could blur the meaning of the word, and take more time to understand the words, since it involves more translation steps. But this could be solved with this tool. This doesn't just provide direct translation of the word, instead, it explains the words with more words, weakening one to one mapping, and helping to learn that words with feelings not the direct translated word.
